KahootFetcher is a tool to get a Kahoot's answers through its UUID. Built with [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## Current Features:

- **Simple Design:** Focus on getting the Kahoot answers with no diversions.
- **Lite Version:** If KahootFetcher didn't work, then use [KahootFetcher Lite](https://orn8.github.io/kahootfetcher/lite), a more robust way to get the answers.
